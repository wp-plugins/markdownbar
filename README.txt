Adds a toolbar of buttons to the Text (HTML) edit which generate Markdown syntax

== Description ==

Adds buttons to the Text (HTML) edit which generate Markdown syntax. These buttons serve as a great introduction to
users who are new to Markdown, as well as shortcuts for more experienced users. The buttons include:

* Bold
* Italic
* Blockquote
* Link
* Code
* Table
* Headers
* Help (links to external Github Markdown guide)

This plugin does not modify the Visual editor, as that editor is not ideal for writing Markdown in. It's recommended you disable 
the Visual editor entirely to enforce using Markdown. 

Note that this plugin **does not render Markdown**. You should use a plugin (such as Jetpack Markdown) to render markdown in your theme.
